# FlowerShop-Class
This program creates a class modeled after the real-world object, a flower shop. Upon instantiation, an object will have a randomized inventory, with each type of flower having 0-10 items in stock. The class will also have a â€œdefault inventory", which is referenced to refresh the inventory of any FlowerShop object. The main function of the class is to simulate purchasing flowers through the use of a shell. The shell should have error handling, and should only exit when the checkout command is called.
